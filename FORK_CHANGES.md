# This fork's changes compared to main STK

This is only a short description.

1. Allowed partly configurable servers (the main game allows either no configuration or full configuration, while this version allows for example enforcing SuperTux difficulty and allowing racing modes only).

2. Resetting server to initial mode and difficulty after all players are gone (doesn't work if players quit mid-race for now).

3. `max-moveable-objects > 24` for bowling addon

4. `/help` and `/commands`

5. Gnu elimination mode: `/gnu`, `/nognu`, `/standings`

6. Allowed forcing players to have certain tracks to enter the server; limiting played tracks to make very custom servers or forbid tracks that crash online

7. Allowed forcing players to have certain number of addons (differentiated by its type) to make addons servers

8. Private chat (`/to`, `/public`) and soccer / ctf `/teamchat`

9. Fixed lap count servers

10. Non-racing servers

11. Official tracks can be not required

12. Allowed storing race results

13. Allowed `/records` queries to server

14. Allowed to have a server in soccer tournament mode.

Of course, there are some further plans ~~which will be announced when they are implemented or when I realize they cannot be implemented~~.
